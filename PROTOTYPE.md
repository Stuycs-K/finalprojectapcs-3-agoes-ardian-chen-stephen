We are making a replica of the Monopoly board game. For our MVP, we plan on making it for 2 players. We also plan on having a board (we could make our own monopoly board with CS related cards/properties), a token (circle or random shape) to represent players, a random number generator button to simulate dice, as well as player UI to display properties bought, money, and current turn. Once a player lands on an unowned property, we will display a simple pop up asking if they want to buy it. If they land on a property owned by someone else, money will automatically be deducted. Once player money drops below 0, the player loses. No selling or morgaging system in MVP. MVP will also not have houses/hotels, chance/community chest, property sets, auctions, trading, or jail. These will all be considered as extra features once MVP is met. Furthermore, complex animations for dice rolling and figurines moving across the board will also be considered as extra features. Lastly, if we have more than two players, we also plan on making an event history to keep track of moves.
